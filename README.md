HOMESCOPE

It's a personal project created for learning purposes. It's built as SPA, using React Router Dom. The main goals of the project are:

1. Practice the use of state management with Redux;
2. Practice different animations with Framer Motion;
3. Practice basic React project building and componentization;
4. Practice the integration of different libraries on the React environment;
5. Get used with the updates on React Router Dom v6.

The project was built upon a simple database collected on a real-estate website and gathered on a JSON file available on the public folder.

The main focus is the building of the user interface, hence there won't be (in a first iteration of the project) a back-end structure. The interations with the JSON file will be made using the local storage.
