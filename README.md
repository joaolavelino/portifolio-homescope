## About the Project
Is's a education project I made in with a couple of goals:

 - Practice with different tools on React: Framer Motion and Styled Components;
 - Practice the interface design aspect of the creation process.
 
It's a real-state website that gathers info from a small JSON file,  and its prossible for the user to add and remove the listings. This is the first version with limited functionality. 


### Here is the link for the website.
